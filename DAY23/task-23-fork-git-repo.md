**Purpose**: Access the fork functionality to create a personal copy of the repository.

---

## üîπ Step 5: Initiate Fork Process

**Action**: Click the **"Fork"** button on the repository page.

**Expected Result**: This should open the "New Repository Fork" dialog/page.

**Fork Dialog Contents** (as shown in screenshot):
- **Owner**: Should be set to "jon" (your username)
- **Fork From**: Shows "sarah/story-blog" as the source
- **Repository Name**: Pre-filled with "story-blog"
- **Visibility**: Options for repository privacy
- **Description**: Optional description field

---

## üîπ Step 6: Configure Fork Settings

**Fork Configuration**:

1. **Owner**: Verify it's set to **"jon"** (should be automatic)

**Expected Process**:
1. Gitea processes the fork request
2. Creates a new repository: `jon/story-blog`
3. Copies all repository content, history, and branches
4. Redirects to the newly created forked repository

---

## üîπ Step 8: Verify Successful Fork

**Verification Steps**:

1. **Check Repository URL**: Should now show `jon/story-blog` instead of `sarah/story-blog`
2. **Verify Fork Indicator**: Repository page should show "forked from sarah/story-blog"
3. **Check Repository Contents**: All files should be present (frogs-and-ox.txt, lion-and-mouse.txt, etc.)
4. **Verify Commit History**: All commits from original repository should be preserved

**Purpose**: Confirm that the fork was created successfully with complete repository content.

---

## üîπ Step 9: Navigate to Dashboard for Final Verification

# üåü Task 29 - Create and Merge Pull Request for Fox and Grapes Story

## üìå Task Description

The **Nautilus application development team** needs to manage changes to a repository on the **Storage server** in **Stratos DC**. Direct pushes to the `master` branch are prohibited to ensure only reviewed and approved content is merged. Max has written a story, "The ü¶ä Fox and Grapes üçá," and pushed it to the `story/fox-and-grapes` branch in the remote Git repository hosted on Gitea. The task is to create a Pull Request (PR) to merge Max's story into the `master` branch, assign Tom as a reviewer, and have Tom review and merge the PR.

üëâ **Your task**: Create a Pull Request for Max's story, assign Tom as a reviewer, and complete the review and merge process via the Gitea UI.

üí° **Note**: Take screenshots or record the process (e.g., using loom.com) for verification in case the task is marked incomplete.

## üí° What is a Pull Request?

**Pull Request Definition**: A Pull Request (PR) is a method to propose and review changes before merging them into a target branch (e.g., `master`). It facilitates collaboration, code review, and quality control.

### **Key Benefits**:
- **Code Review**: Ensures changes are validated by team members.
- **Controlled Merging**: Prevents direct pushes to critical branches.
- **Collaboration**: Allows discussion and feedback on changes.
- **Traceability**: Maintains a record of changes and approvals.

### **How Pull Requests Work**:
1. **Create PR**: Propose changes from a source branch to a target branch.
2. **Assign Reviewers**: Team members review the proposed changes.
3. **Discuss and Revise**: Address feedback and make necessary updates.
4. **Merge**: Approved changes are merged into the target branch.
5. **Update Remote**: Merged changes are reflected in the remote repository.

### **Common Use Cases**:
- **Feature Integration**: Add new features after review.
- **Bug Fixes**: Validate fixes before merging.
- **Team Collaboration**: Coordinate changes across distributed teams.
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure code meets standards before merging.

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Issue 1: PR Creation Fails**
**Symptoms**: Unable to create PR due to branch conflicts or permissions.
**Solution**: Ensure branches are up-to-date and user has correct permissions.
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout story/fox-and-grapes
git pull origin story/fox-and-grapes
```

### **Issue 2: Reviewer Not Notified**
**Symptoms**: Tom does not receive PR review notification.
**Solution**: Verify Tom is correctly assigned in the Gitea UI and reassign if needed.

### **Issue 3: Merge Conflicts**
**Symptoms**: PR cannot be merged due to conflicts.
**Solution**: Resolve conflicts locally, push updates, and retry merge.
```bash
git checkout story/fox-and-grapes
git merge master
# Resolve conflicts in files
git add <resolved-files>
git commit
git push origin story/fox-and-grapes
```

### **Issue 4: Merge Button Disabled**
**Symptoms**: Merge button is grayed out in Gitea UI.
**Solution**: Ensure Tom has reviewed and approved the PR, and all required checks (if any) are complete.

## üö® Task-Specific Challenge & Solution

**üîç Main Challenge Encountered:**

The primary challenge was **ensuring controlled integration of Max‚Äôs story** into the `master` branch while adhering to the review process to maintain code quality and prevent direct pushes.

**üí° Solution Approach:**
